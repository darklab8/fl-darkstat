While some saw experimental deployment during the conflict with Gallia, the weapon's difficult handling with its slow firing rate, low range, and massive energy consumption led Bowex to scrap it. In the design's brief existence, its licensure to other companies caused some examples to leak out onto the open markets, although only expert freighter pilots can really appreciate its potential.</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT> </TEXT><PARA/><TRA data="1" mask="1" def="-2"/><JUST loc="center"/><TEXT>Shield Damage Modifiers</TEXT><PARA/><TRA data="0" mask="1" def="-1"/><TEXT> </TEXT><PARA/><JUST loc="left"/><TEXT>Graviton: 110%</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>Molecular: 75%</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>Positron: 90%</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
